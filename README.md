# Clothing store website DEMO

 This project is a web application called 'Clothing Store Website DEMO', where users can navigate through the application, browse clothing, view specific items upon clicking on them, add preferred items to favorites, explore sellers and their stores by following links to Telegram or Instagram, and so on. The application is built using modern web technologies like: React, Redux, HTML, Sass and so on. 'DEMO Clothing Store Website' is an interactive web program that enables users to select products. As this application is still in development and hence referred to as DEMO, some functionality is currently unavailable, but this project is not stagnant and is being actively developed by the developer. It also has good potential to benefit both the seller and customers who appreciate its original design. Stay tuned for further application updates; we'll meet again soon!

## Technologies
This project has been developed using the following technologies:

React: The core library for building the user interface.

React Router: Used for creating navigation between different pages of the application.

React Fragment: It's a tool in React that groups multiple elements without adding extra HTML. 

React Component: For building blocks of UI in React apps.  

useState: A React hook for managing component state.

useEffect: Is versatile and allows to manage various side effects within functional components.

Redux: In essence, Redux serves as a powerful state management library that helps in maintaining a single source of truth for an application's state, simplifying state changes and aiding in better organization and debugging within complex applications.

TypeScript: Aims to address some of the shortcomings of JavaScript, especially in terms of catching errors during development, improving code quality, and enhancing developer productivity in larger projects.

SCSS: Utilized for styling and designing the interface.

npm: A utility for managing project packages and dependencies.
